5 Recent Student Protests That Made a Big Difference
=================

Cosmo's Hannah Smothers pointed out in a [recent article](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/politics/a18660180/teen-student-led-protests-america/):

>if you're surprised to see teenagers form a cohesive movement with an ambitious goal they're actively working toward, you haven't been paying close enough attention. 

She highlights 5 student-led protests that have created real change in this decade alone:

* In 2012, Dreamers and other undocumented youth organized sit-ins that convinced the Obama administration to suspend deportations of Dreamers

* Youth-led protests in 2014 in Ferguson, MO, helped start the #BlackLivesMatter movement

* Student-led protests against racism at University of Missouri in 2015 toppled a college president and transformed the campus

* Students at Yale and dozens of colleges around the country marched and protested in favor of racial and gender equality and inclusion

* The massive 2016 protests at Standing Rock were started by a few Lakota Sioux teenagers who founded the One Mind Youth Movement and organized against the Dakota XL Pipeline
