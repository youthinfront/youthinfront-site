This article also references the Virgina superintendent’s threat to suspend students and includes a response from the ACLU, TCRP, and Texas Appleseed. The three organizations maintained that suspension was unlawful for the following reasons:
* The first amendment protects a person’s right to expression and 
* Schools are not authorized to impose “content-based” restrictions for expressions that do not limit the functioning of schools.
The letter to the superintendent also discouraged imposing the suspension for students who participated in the protest.
