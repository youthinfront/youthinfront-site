Why Protest?: Greensboro, NC Lunch Counter Sit-Ins, 1960
================= 

On Feb. 1, 1960, 4 African-American students from North Carolina Agricultural and Technical Colleges staged a sit-in at the Woolworth whites-only lunch counter in Greensboro, NC, in order to force Woolworth to change its policy of racial segregation. They refused to leave even after they were denied service and the police arrived. Over the next few days, over 300 more students joined them in a peaceful sit-in and coordinated media coverage generated national support. By that summer, Woolworth reversed its policy. The Woolworth Sit-In nonviolent movement became the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee, also known as SNCC, which achieved additional victories in organizing and political reform throughout the decade.
