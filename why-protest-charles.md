Why Protest?: Charles Maudlin
=================

>“You have to take one step at a time, day by day. John Lewis once said, 'Find ways to get in the way of what is wrong in life' - injustice, discrimination, racism, and now gun violence. Find ways to get in the way of what you see as wrong. And realize that you don’t have to be extraordinary to change the world…you just have to do ordinary things on a constant basis. Stand up each day.” 

-Charles Maudlin, Civil Rights Leader. 

At age 16, Mauldin became a student leader in the voting rights movement; he was with John Lewis leading the marchers from Selma to Montgomery when they were attacked by law enforcement on Bloody Sunday in 1965.
