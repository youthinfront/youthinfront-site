What's the difference: Walkout, March, Protest?
=================

**Walkouts** and **marches** are both forms of **protest**: ways of making a public statement to voice disapproval and your opinion to influence policy and public opinion. Walkouts and protests both use collective action, where many people coordinate their protest at the same time and on the same day to make their voices heard and their messages louder. 

Walkout
-------

[**_The action of leaving a meeting or organization as an expression of disapproval._**](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/walkout)

**Should I participate in a walkout?** 

Check your schedule: is your school in session on one of these days? Some schools will have Spring Break in March, or April Vacation on April 20

**Silence**

The walkout is typically done in silence as a show of respect for victims and to emphasize that our absence is not a threat or distraction from school

**Speech**

After the 17 minute walkout, organizers recommend holding an open mic where student voices can be heard.

March
-----

[**_A protest march is a type of protest or demonstration that generally involves a group of people walking from an assembly point to a predetermined destination, usually culminating in a political rally_**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Protest_marches)

**March 24**

Students and others will gather in Washington, DC and in other locations around the country to rally and march through cities and towns. Unlike the walkouts, students will need to go to the location of the march, rather than participating from their schools. 

_Should I participate?_

Unlike the walkouts, this march is on a weekend. Check the website to see if there is a march organized near you, and plan your transportation.
