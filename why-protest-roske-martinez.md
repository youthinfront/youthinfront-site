Why Protest?: Xiuhtezcatl Roske-Martinez
=================

>“The proof is right in front of us. This is happening now, this is happening here, and this is real.” 

-Xiuhtezcatl Roske-Martinez, youth activist

At the age of 6, Xiuhtezcatl gave a speech at a rally organized to make people aware of how the changing climate was destroying the forests of Boulder, Colorado. By the time he was a teenager, he had organized and participated in dozens of marches and rallies. His efforts and arguments convinced the Boulder City Council to take positive actions to protect the forest from further harm, including ending contracts with gas and electric energy companies. His actions were simple—he spoke from his heart, he created multimedia presentations, and he communicated with anyone who would listen. At the end of the day, he believes that making your voice heard is what makes the difference. Read more about him [here](https://www.giraffe.org/giraffe-heroes/xiuhtezcatl-roske-martinez).
