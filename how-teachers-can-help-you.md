Help Your Teachers Help You
=================

Many of your teachers may believe in what you’re doing but not be able to support you directly because they need to stay neutral in the classroom.  Even if they are required to give you an unexcused absence or a failing grade for walking out, there are still ways they can prevent you from making the punishment too harsh.  Offer these suggestions to your teachers for how they can help you:
* Don’t schedule quizzes, tests, or student presentations for walkout day
* Post classwork and homework online so it’s easy to make up
* Offer extra credit (that could make up for a failing grade!) for subject-related work about the protests or another current event
* Hold a teach-in where students can educate one another about the issues
