Black and Brown Youth Activists from Ferguson
Black and Brown students who protested at Ferguson received a very different reception than the one that the predominantly white students who are protesting the Parkland shootings are receiving (MsPackyetti on Twitter)
“In the wake of Trayvon Martin’s death at the hands of a security guard in 2012, young people mobilized under the name Black Lives Matter to demand reforms very similar to those now being articulated by students in Parkland. 
They did not receive the same support or recognition that the nation has given Parkland students in the last two weeks.” ( Weekend Read: Teen activists aren't new. Celebrating them is, February 28, 2018)

Evidence that Black youth have been working for gun reform:
The Black Youth Project 100 (BYP100) was founded in 2013 in response to the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting of Trayvon Martin
