How to Respond to Student Activism about Gun Violence
=================

School leaders should *listen*, help to *empower*, and *affirm students' rights* to express their views.

* Let your students take the lead; allow them to tell you how they would like to join this movement.
* Stand in support of your students' right to expression, and take their perspectives seriously. It’s not necessary to endorse any particular viewpoint in order to affirm students’ rights to express their views.
* Ask students what they need from adults in order to feel safe and nurtured in school.
* Challenge students to connect their current protests with the history of activism on gun control and with traditions of protest against community violence in urban centers.
