Exploring activism as a long term fight
=============================

**Lesson plan: How does progress happen in a democracy?**

[Read an excerpt](https://www.facinghistory.org/holocaust-and-human-behavior/chapter-12/not-just-awareness-action) from President Obama’s 2016 commencement address at Howard University. He discusses how civic participation has to happen in multiple ways. It requires critical questioning, mobilizing a community, holding lawmakers accountable, voting, and listening to people with whom you disagree. Most of all, “Change isn’t something that happens every four years or eight years; change is not placing your faith in any particular politician and then just putting your feet up and saying, okay, go. Change is the effort of committed citizens who hitch their wagons to something bigger than themselves and fight for it every single day.”

After reading, discuss with students:
- How might President Obama sum up the duties of citizens?
- What does Obama’s speech add to your thinking about the power and limitations of social media to bring about change?
- What might it look like to apply some of Obama’s ideas about making change to an issue that you care about?
